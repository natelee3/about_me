        <h2>Dr. Nate Lee</h2>
        <p>I just completed my fourth year serving as Instructor of Percussion at Reinhardt University. My duties included
            teaching applied percussion lessons, directing the Reinhardt Percussion Ensemble, composing for and instructing the 
            Reinhardt Screaming Eagle Drumline, teaching Percussion Methods to aspiring band directors, and coordinating the Aural Skills
            program. </p>
            <p> 
              In addition, I perform regularly with the Charleston Symphony, Lousiana Philharmonic, and several
              other regional orchestras. I've maintained a private studio of talented middle- and high-school percussionists and 
              an active clinic and adjudication schedule. 
            </p>
            <p> I spent nearly 10 years in college and have earned several degrees: 
                <li>BA Economics - Indiana University</li>
                <li>BM Percussion Performance - Indiana University</li>
                <li>MM Percussion Peformance - University of Georgia</li>
                <li>DMA Percussion Performance - University of Georgia</li> 
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in Hickory Flat with my wife Stephanie, mother-in-law Amparo, and our lovable husky-mix Chance.
                We're expecting our first child this September!!
            </p>
            <p>
                I've dabbled with html, python, and javascript over the past few years and I'm really looking forward to learning more 
                programming here at Digital Crafts.
